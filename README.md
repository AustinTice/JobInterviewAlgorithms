# JobInterviewAlgorithms
A library of classic algorithms that you will find when interviewing for software engineering jobs.

This libary will consist of directories that contain classic job interview algorithms. Inside each folder there will be
files that coincide with different programming languages' solutions. If you would like to write a new algorithm, or possibly add a new
solution for a different language, feel free to submit a [pull request](https://github.com/AustinTice/JobInterviewAlgorithms/pulls).
